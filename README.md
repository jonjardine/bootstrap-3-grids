# bootstrap-3-grids
Adobe Illustrator Bootstrap 3 grid template files

Contains a master Illustrator file with four artboards, one for each of:

- extra-small (xs, < 768px)
- small (sm < 992px)
- medium (md < 1200px)
- large (>= 1200px)

Each artboard contains five layers, two with fills for containers and their padding, two with guides in place for containers and padding, and a final layer with page padding fills for sizes greater than extra-small. The page padding for the three artboards greater than extra small is to allow for container-fluid layouts and jumbotrons which extend across the full width of the page.

Artwork saved as a Creative Cloud template, along with Illustrator documents in Creative Cloud, CS6 and CS5 formats. Give me a shout if you want an earlier format.

Can also provide PSD templates on request.
